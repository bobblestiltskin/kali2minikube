# kali2minikube
A script (apt.sh) to install minikube and dependencies on a vanilla kali raspberry pi 5 installation (https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi-5/)

I used root@raspberrypi:/home/bob# dd if=./new/kali-linux-2023.4-raspberry-pi5-arm64.img of=/dev/sdg bs=64M conv=sync
to install the image.

Also a script (hello.sh) to install hello-minikube and one to install mongodb (mongodb.sh).

I have not run the scripts as is yet, I have cut'n'pasted each line.
