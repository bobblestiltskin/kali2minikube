# kali2minikube
A script (apt.sh) to install minikube and dependencies on a vanilla kali raspberry pi 5 installation (https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi-5/)

Also a script (hello.sh) to install hello-minikube and one to install mongodb (mongodb.sh).

I have not run the scripts as is yet, I have cut'n'pasted each line.
